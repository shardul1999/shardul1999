I am a student of Computer Science with specific interests primarily in Machine Learning and Data Science but also Software Development. 
I want to work on newer problems and create realistic solutions that can help ease the life of people around us or just help reach 
the desired end goal. I want to learn more and more and become an expert in my chosen field and for that, I need experience trying to
solve a lot of problems.
